# Production-Ready Web Platform (DevOps)

This repository contains a hands-on DevOps project focused on
designing and implementing a production-ready web platform on AWS.

The goal is not to build a feature-rich application, but to create
a highly available, secure, and automated platform suitable for
running stateless web workloads.

The project is developed iteratively:
- architecture and responsibility definition first
- infrastructure design
- infrastructure as code
- CI/CD and observability

Target role: DevOps / Platform Engineer.
